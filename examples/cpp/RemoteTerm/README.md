A simple example showing how to use QTermWidget to control and display a remote terminal.

To run this example, you should: 
1. Build client-side program. In my PC, I use 'apt-get' to install the QTermWidget library.
2. Start the shell-srv.py with specific parameters.This will expose a shell via socket.
3. Start the client-side program from commandline with specific parameters.

Now you will get your own remote terminal work with QTermWidget.
