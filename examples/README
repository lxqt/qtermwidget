Examples using QTermWidget
==========================

This directory contains minimal examples showing how to embed and use `QTermWidget` in both C++ and Python (PyQt/PySide) applications.

Contents
--------
* `cpp/main.cpp` – Basic single–terminal C++ example with menu actions (Find / Copy / Paste / About Qt) and runtime selection of color schemes and key bindings via command‑line arguments.
* `cpp/RemoteTerm/` – A simple remote client example that connects to a TCP server exposing a pseudo terminal. Local keystrokes are sent to the remote host; data received over the socket is written into the local PTY backing the widget.
* `pyqt/` – Python examples (PyQt/PySide) demonstrating how to instantiate and configure the terminal widget from Python. See the files inside for details.

Building C++ Examples
---------------------

Configure the build (top level) and enable example targets as needed:

```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DBUILD_EXAMPLE=ON -DBUILD_EXAMPLE_REMOTETERM=ON ..
cmake --build . -j
```

Resulting binaries (paths relative to the build directory):
* `./example` – the basic example.
* `./remoteterm` – the remote terminal client (only if `BUILD_EXAMPLE_REMOTETERM=ON`).

Running the Basic Example
-------------------------
```
./example [colorScheme] [keyBinding]
```

You can pass any available color scheme or key binding name (both optional). To list what is available, just run without arguments – they are also printed to stdout on startup.

RemoteTerm Example
------------------
Usage:
```
./remoteterm <ipaddr> <port>
```

It will:
1. Start a local, empty PTY via `startTerminalTeletype()`.
2. Connect a `QTcpSocket` to the remote server.
3. Forward local user keystrokes (via the `sendData` signal) to the socket.
4. Write any incoming socket data directly into the PTY so it appears in the widget.

This is a minimal client-only demonstration. A corresponding server program (not included here) must:
* Accept a TCP connection.
* Spawn or attach to a PTY on the server side.
* Forward data bidirectionally between the PTY and the socket.

Python Examples
---------------
Install the Python bindings (PyQt6 recommended for Qt6 builds) and run the scripts directly, for example:
```
python3 pyqt/basic.py
```
Adjust according to the actual script names present in `pyqt/`.

Customization Highlights (C++)
------------------------------
Some frequently-used APIs shown in the examples:
* `setTerminalFont(QFont)` – choose a monospace font.
* `setColorScheme(name)` / `availableColorSchemes()` – theme control.
* `setKeyBindings(name)` / `availableKeyBindings()` – load alternate key mapping tables.
* `toggleShowSearchBar()` – show/hide the built-in incremental search bar.
* `copyClipboard()` / `pasteClipboard()` – clipboard integration.
* `finished` signal – emitted when the child shell/pty terminates (connect to close your window/application).

Troubleshooting
---------------
* If you see a link error about a missing vtable for `RemoteTerm`, ensure CMake ran `moc` on `remoteterm.h` (requires `Q_OBJECT` macro and `BUILD_EXAMPLE_REMOTETERM=ON`).
* For OpenGL / Qt GUI discovery errors during configuration, install your distribution's OpenGL development packages (e.g. `libgl-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu) and ensure your `Qt6` installation is complete.

License
-------
The examples are provided under the same licensing terms as the library (see the top-level `LICENSE` files). Individual source files retain their original header notices.

Contributions
-------------
Pull requests adding small, focused examples (e.g. tabbed terminals, custom color schemes, server counterpart for `RemoteTerm`) are welcome—keep them minimal and well-commented.
